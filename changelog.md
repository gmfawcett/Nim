## v0.20.0 - XX/XX/2018

### Changes affecting backwards compatibility

- The ``isLower``, ``isUpper`` family of procs in strutils/unicode
  operating on **strings** have been
  deprecated since it was unclear what these do. Note that the much more
  useful procs that operator on ``char`` or ``Rune`` are not affected.

- `strutils.editDistance` has been deprecated,
  use `editdistance.editDistance` or `editdistance.editDistanceAscii`
  instead.
